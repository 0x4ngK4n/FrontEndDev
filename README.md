# FrontEndDev

## This repository serves as a sink for me to learn front-end development.
### The idea is to develop code for fun as well as to build my insight as a developer.
### I believe that developing such an insight can be helpful when I am conducting a secure code review to find bugs to exploit.

### **Note**: This repo will be updated as I set sizeable goals and develop corresponding applications.

**Current Task list**
- [] Project 1: Build a budget calculator using HTML, CSS and JS
